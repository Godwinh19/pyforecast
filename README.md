## PyForecast

The purpose of this project is to offer a panoply of forecasting algorithms
in order to be able to carry out forecasting studies without having worry about
the code base.

### Supported Algorithms

- N-beats
- SARIMA

### Algorithms in queue

- LSTM, CNN, etc
- FbProphet
- etc

### TO-DO

Based on different algorithms, we can make a benchmark for comparison,
add metrics. Also, be able to visualize results.
